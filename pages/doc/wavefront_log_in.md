Wavefront is a high-performance streaming analytics platform that supports observability for metrics, counters, histograms, and traces/spans. You can log in to Wavefront from the Cloud Services Portal. Starting with this 2021-XY release, you can log in to Wavefront by using your VMware Cloud services account.

## Create a VMware Cloud Services Account

If you want to learn more about what our cloud services do, and how you can run, manage, connect, and secure your entire application portfolio on any cloud to any device, visit https://cloud.vmware.com/.

You can sign up for one or more VMware Cloud services at https://cloud.vmware.com/ and complete the steps in the onboarding flow.

During the onboarding process, you create a cloud service account with your VMware ID. If you do not have a My VMware account, you create one as you sign up. You also set up an organization. VMware Cloud uses organizations to provide controlled access to one or more services. Your VMware Cloud services account is contained within an organization.

1. Initiate the onboarding process from the service sign-up or from your invitation link.
2. Follow the steps to create your VMware Cloud services account.
3. Sign in to VMware Cloud services with your VMware ID.

When you have set up your account, you can invite other people to join your organization. They will receive an email with a link to onboard.
