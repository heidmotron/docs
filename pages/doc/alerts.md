Tanzu Observability supports smart alerts that dynamically filter noise and capture true anomalies.
* When the alert condition is met, an alert notifies one or more **alert targets**, which receive the alert notification(s).
* The **alert notification** includes an image and a link to see the alert in context.
* Look all alerts in the **Alert Browser** or examine a single firing alert in the **Alert Viewer**.

{% include note.html content="All users can view alerts and perform the tasks on this page. You need [Alerts permissions](permissions_overview.html) to create and modify alerts. If some of the alerts in your environment are under [access control](access.html), you can view or view and modify those alerts only if they've been shared with you." %}


## How Alerts Work Videos

In this video, Clement explains how single-threshold alerts work:

## Examine an Alert in Alert Viewer

When you receive an alert notification, it includes a link to the alert in Alert Viewer. The related information in Alert Viewer can help you determine what's going on.

<tr>
<td width="50%">
Use the <strong>Affected</strong> section to determine what is failing. <br/><br/>
When an alert fires, Wavefront analyzes the point tags that are most likely to be related to the firing alert and displays them in ranked order in the Alert Viewer. These point tags are a list of suspects for why the alert is firing. For example, if the alert is caused by an outage in region=us-west-2, Wavefront ranks this tag higher than other tags.</td>

<td width="50%"><img src="/images/alert_viewer_data.png" alt="Data section displaying the alert query and condition"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Examine and Manage All Alerts in Alerts Browser

You can view and manage all alerts from the Alerts Browser.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<br/>
To examine alerts in the Alerts Browser, click <strong>Alerting</strong> in the taskbar. A colored dot next to <strong>Alerting</strong> indicates that there are firing alerts. Hover over the <strong>Alerting</strong> button in the taskbar to see how many alerts are currently firing.</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/alerts_taskbar.png" alt="multiple firing alerts on the clock icon next to text Alerting in taskbar."></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<br/>
To find exactly the alerts that you need you can:
<ul><li>Type the alert name in the search field</li>
<li>Use a filter, for example, select <strong>State</strong>, <strong>Severity</strong>, <strong>Services</strong>, <strong>Applications</strong>, or alert tag. </li></ul>
For example, you could show alerts that are both FIRING and SEVERE.</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/alert_firing_severe.png" alt="Firing and Severe selected in filter bar on left."></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



### Examine an Alert in Alerts Browser

The Alerts Browser shows the properties and current state of an alert. For example, an alert that is firing looks like this:

![Annotated screenshot highlighting the UI elements which are described in the text below](images/alert_firing.png)

Here's a summary of what you can do:
* Click the ellipsis icon for a menu.
* Click the chart icon next to the status for alert details. If the alert is firing, the Alert Viewer displays.
* View the alert condition and points.
* Below the severity:
  - View the last affected series, including the affected sources and point tags.
  - View the targets.
  For multi-threshold alerts, you see this information for each severity.
* Examine [alert tags](alerts_manage.html#organize-related-alerts-with-alert-tags) or add a tag to make filtering for the alert easier.


### View Alert Details

To view alert details, click the chart icon in the State column in the Alerts Browser.
* If the alert is in FIRING state, the Alert Viewer displays
* If the alert is not in FIRING state, a chart displays with these queries:

- **&lt;Alert name&gt;** - the alert's Display Expression, if there is one. Otherwise, the alert condition.
- **Past Firings** - an [events() query](events_queries.html) that shows past firings of the alert.

For example, for the `Latency Dev Alert` shown above, the chart looks like this:

![Chart with 2 queries corresponding to alert shown in first section](images/v2_alert_queries.png)


### View Alert History

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<br/>
Alert history shows the changes that have been made to an alert over time.<br/><br/>

To access the alert history, click the ellipsis icon on the left of the alert in the Alerts Browser and click <strong>Versions</strong>.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="images/alert_history.png" alt="alert history selected in menu"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Alert history shows:
* Which user made the changes.
* The date and time the changes were made.
* A description of the changes.
You can revert back to a past alert version or clone a past alert version.



## Organize Related Alerts With Alert Tags

You can use alert tags to organize related alerts into categories. Alert tags are especially useful for setting up [maintenance  windows](maintenance_windows_managing.html#using-maintenance-windows). You can:
* [Search or filter](wavefront_searching.html) the list of alerts in the Alerts Browser to show only a category of alerts.
* Suppress a category of alerts during a [maintenance window](maintenance_windows_managing.html#using-maintenance-windows).
* [Reference a group of alert metrics](alerts_dependencies.html#referencing-alert-metrics) in a single expression.

### Manage Alert Tags

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="70%">
<br/>
You can add a new or existing alert tag at any time:
<ul>
<li>Set the <strong>Tags</strong> property when you create or edit the alert. </li>
<li>Click plus (<strong>+</strong>) at the bottom of the alert in the Alerts Browser.</li>
<li>Select one or more alerts in the Alerts Browser and click <strong>+Tag</strong> or <strong>-Tag</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, you might assign tags like networkOps, underDevelopment, and eastCoast. All users can later search for one or more of these tags to find any other alerts that are in the same category or combination of categories.</p>

### Use Multi-Level Alert Tags

If your environment has a nested set of categories, you can use alert tag paths. For example, suppose you have created a group of alerts that you use as demo examples, and:
* Within the demo group, some alerts monitor network activity, while others monitor request latency.
* Within each subgroup, some alerts monitor production applications, while others monitor development applications.

To manage these alerts, you assign the tag paths `example.network.prod`, `example.network.dev`, `example.latency.prod`, and `example.latency.dev`. The Alerts Browser below shows the tag paths as a hierarchy under **Tag Paths** on the left. You can click **example** and then **network** to view all alerts that have a tag path that starts with `example.network`.

![Alert tag path](images/alert_tag_path.png)

When you create a maintenance window, you can use a wildcard to match tag path components:

* `example.*.*` matches the entire group of demo alerts.
* `example.latency.*` matches all of the alerts that monitor request latency.
* `example.*.prod` matches all of the production alerts.

When you have many and complex tag paths, you can search them by parent. For example, if you have the tag paths `example.network.prod`, `example.network.dev`, `example.latency.prod`, and `example.latency.dev`, you can perform a search by **example** and the search returns all of its children.

## Alert Events

Wavefront creates [events](events.html) as alerts fire, update, and resolve. You can optionally [display those events](charts_events_displaying.html) as icons on a chart's X-axis:

![event icons](images/event_icons.png)

{% include note.html content="If you don't have [access](access.html) to an alert, you also won't see the corresponding alert events." %}
