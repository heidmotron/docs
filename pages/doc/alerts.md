summary: Learn how alerts work, and how to create and examine them.
---
With Wavefront, you can create smart alerts that dynamically filter noise and capture true anomalies.
* Specify one or more **alert targets** that receive the alert notification(s).
* Create a **multi-threshold alert** to notify different targets depending on alert severity.
* View an image of the chart in the alert notification and click a link to see the alert in context.
* Examine firing alerts in **Alert Viewer** to get context.

The end result is fewer false alerts and faster remediation when real issues occur.

{% include note.html content="All users can view alerts. You need [Alerts permissions](permissions_overview.html) to create and modify alerts. If some of the alerts in your environment are under [access control](access.html), you can view or view and modify those alerts only if they've been shared with you." %}


## Wavefront Alerts

An alert defines:
* The condition under which metric values indicate a system problem.
* One or more targets to notify when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period of time.
* Optionally, information about the alert notification format.

Wavefront supports classic alerts, where each alert has one preset severity, and multi-threshold alerts, where an alert can have different severities for different threshold values.

### How to Create an Alert -- The Basics

You can create an alert from any chart, or from the **Create Alert** page. The basic process is the same.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>Specify the alert condition, for example, CPU utilization is less than 70%. </li>
<li>Optionally use backtesting to see how often the alert fires and adjust the threshold. </li>
<li>Add an alert target, that is, specify who will receive the alert and how (e.g., email or PagerDuty), then save the alert. </li></ol></td>
<td width="50%"><a href="https://youtu.be/CDqUWDA9NBM
"><img src="/images/v_alert_creation_overview.png" alt="Video of alert creation overview"/></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The rest of this page explains:
* How you can fine-tune the process to get just the right number of alerts to just the right people.
* How to create alerts and customize the condition and the target.
* How to create multi-threshold alerts, which can send notifications to different targets based on the severity of the problem.

### Alert Condition

The alert condition is a query language expression that defines the threshold for an alert.
* If an alert's Condition field is set to a conditional expression, for example `ts("requests.latency") > 195`, then all data values that satisfy the condition are marked as `true` (1) and all data values that do not satisfy the condition are marked as `false` (0).
* If the Condition field is set to a base ts(), hs(), etc. expression, for example `ts("cpu.loadavg.1m")`, then all _non-zero_ data values are marked as `true` and all zero data values are marked as `false`. If there is _no reported data_, then values are neither true nor false.

An alert [fires](alerts_states_lifecycle.html#when-do-alerts-fire) when a metric stays at a value that indicates a problem for the specified amount of time.
* A **classic alert** sends a notification with the specified severity to all specified targets.
* A **multi-threshold alert** allows you to specify multiple severities and a different target for each severity. Each target is notified if the condition is met when the alert changes state.

### Alert Target

Each alert is associated with one or more alert targets. The alert target specifies who to notify when the alert changes state.
* For classic alerts, you specify a (single) severity and one or more corresponding alert targets. You can set up email, PagerDuty, and custom alert targets.
* For multi-threshold alerts, you can specify a different alert target for each threshold, for example, an email target when the alert reaches the INFO threshold and a PagerDuty target when the alert reaches the SEVERE threshold. You can specify only custom alert targets, but it's easy to set up a custom email or PagerDuty alert target.

   {% include note.html content="Alert targets subscribe to all notifications at their severity and above. For example, an alert target for an INFO severity receives all notifications for INFO, SMOKE, WARN,  and SEVERE. Because notifications potentially go to targets of different severities, you cannot associate an alert target with more than one severity. " %}

The **maximum number** of email alert targets is 10 for classic alerts and 10 per severity for multi-threshold alerts. If you exceed the number, you receive a message like the following:


`{"status":{"result":"ERROR","message":"Invalid notification specified: null","code":400}}`

</p>


## Creating an Alert

You can create a classic alert with a single severity level (e.g., SEVERE), or a [multi-threshold alert](#create-a-multi-threshold-alert), which allows you to customize alert behavior for different thresholds.


### Create a Classic Alert

**Required fields** for a classic alert are:
* Alert name (default is New Alert)
* Alert condition
* Alert severity

To notify alert targets when the alert changes state, you can specify targets during alert creation or later.

**To create a classic alert:**

<ol>

<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li markdown="span"><strong>Alerts Browser</strong> - Click <strong>Alerting</strong> from the taskbar and click the <strong>Create Alert</strong> button located above the filter bar.</li>
<li markdown="span">**Chart** - Click the ellipsis icon on the right of the query and select **Create Alert**.
![create_alert](images/v2_create_alert.png)</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Specify the following required alert properties.
<table id="alert-properties">
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Property</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
<td>Name of the alert. 1-255 characters. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Condition</strong></td>
<td>A conditional expression that defines the threshold for the alert. The condition expression can include any valid <a href=
"query_language_getting_started.html">Wavefront Query Language</a> construct. The condition expression coupled with the <strong>Alert fires</strong> setting determines when the alert fires.
<ul><li><strong>Alert fires</strong> - Length of time (in minutes) during which the <strong>Condition</strong> expression must be <em>true</em> before the alert fires. Minimum is 1.  For example, if you enter 5, the alerting engine reviews the value of the condition during the last 5-minute window to determine whether the alert should fire.</li>
<li><strong>Alert resolves</strong> - Length of time (in minutes) during which the <strong>Condition</strong> expression must be <em>not true</em> before the alert switches to resolved. Minimum is 1.  Omit this setting or pick a value that is greater than or equal to the <strong>Alert fires</strong> value to avoid resolve-fire cycles. </li>
</ul>

For details and examples, see <a href="alerts_states_lifecycle.html">Alert States and Lifecycle</a>.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Severity</strong></td>
<td>How important the alert is. In decreasing importance:  SEVERE, WARN, SMOKE, and INFO.</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
</li>

<li>(Recommended) Specify a <strong>Display Expression</strong>. Defaults to the value of the condition expression, either 0 or 1. Specify a display expression to get more details when the alert changes state.

The display expression can include any valid Wavefront Query Language construct, and typically captures the underlying time series that the condition expression is testing. The results of the display expression are:
<ul>
<li>Shown in the <strong>Events Display</strong> preview chart on the page for creating or editing the alert.</li>
<li markdown="span">Shown in any [chart image](alerts_notifications.html#chart-images-in-alert-notifications) that is included in a notification triggered by the alert.</li>
<li  markdown="span">Shown in the [interactive chart](alerts_notifications.html#interactive-charts-linked-by-alert-notifications) you can visit from a notification triggered by the alert.</li>
<li markdown="span">Used as the basis for any [statistics](alert_target_customizing.html#alert-series-statistics) that you might include in a [custom notification](alert_target_customizing.html) triggered by the alert. </li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>
(Optional) To help you find the alert and information about it in the Alerts Browser, specify <strong>Additional Information</strong> and <strong>Tags</strong>.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>

<li>(Recommended) Specify a list of alert targets to notify when the alert changes state, for example, from CHECKING to FIRING, or when the alert is snoozed. You can specify up to ten different targets across the following types. Use commas to separate targets of the same type.
<table id="alert-targets">

</p>

### Create a Multi-Threshold Alert

**Required fields** for a multi-threshold alert are:
* Alert name (defaults to New Alert)
* Alert condition and operator (e.g., greater than (**>**))
* At least one severity/threshold value pair.

For each severity, you can specify one or more alert targets to notify [when the alert changes state](alerts_states_lifecycle.html#when-threshold-alerts-notify-targets). Each target is notified if the condition is met when the alert changes state.

Only custom alert targets are supported, but you can initially create the alert without specifying a target.

{% include note.html content="You cannot associate an alert target with more than one severity. Alert targets subscribe to all notifications at their severity and above.

For example, an alert target for an INFO severity receives all notifications for INFO, SMOKE, WARN,  and SEVERE. Because notifications potentially go to targets of different severities, you cannot associate an alert target with more than one severity. "%}

For a multi-threshold alert, Wavefront creates a display expression that shows the alert condition.

**To create a multi-threshold alert:**

<ol>

<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li markdown="span"><strong>Alerts Browser</strong> - Click <strong>Alerting</strong> from the taskbar and click the <strong>Create Alert</strong> button located above the filter bar.</li>
<li markdown="span">**Chart** - Click the ellipsis icon on the right of the query and select **Create Alert**.
![create_alert](images/v2_create_alert.png)</li>
</ul></li>
<li markdown="span">Next to **Type**, select **Threshold**.
</li>
<li>Fill in the following required alert properties.
<table id="alert-properties">
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Property</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
<td>Name of the alert. 1-255 characters. </td>
</tr>

<td><strong>Condition</strong></td>
<td>A query language expression that defines the threshold for the alert. The condition expression can include any valid <a href=

<ul><li><strong>Alert fires</strong> - Length of time (in minutes) during which the <strong>Condition</strong> expression must be <em>true</em> before the alert fires. Minimum is 1.  For example, if you enter 5, the alerting engine reviews the value of the condition during the last 5 minute window to determine whether the alert should fire.</li>
<li><strong>Alert resolves</strong> - Length of time (in minutes) during which the <strong>Condition</strong> expression must be <em>not true</em> before the alert switches to resolved. Minimum is 1.  Omit this setting or pick a value that is greater than or equal to the <strong>Alert fires</strong> to avoid potential chains of resolve-fire cycles. </li>
</ul>

For details and examples, see <a href="alerts_states_lifecycle.html">Alert States and Lifecycle</a>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Operator</strong></td>
<td>Select one of the operators, for example, greater than or &gt;. The operator determines which values to use for the different severity thresholds. For example, if the operator is greater than, then:
<ul><li>You don't have to specify all 4 severities.</li>
<li>SEVERE must be the highest number</li>
<li>INFO must be the lowest number</li>
<li>The numbers must increase from INFO to SEVERE. </li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Severity</strong></td>
<td>For multi-threshold alerts, specify more than one severity - or create a Classic alert. Associate a threshold value with each severity. The order must match the operator.
<br/><br/>For example, you can specify an Operator >=, SEVERE 6000, and WARN 5000, but you can't specify SEVERE 5000, and WARN 6000 with that operator.
