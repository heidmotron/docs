summary: Get an overview of the services and applications that send data to Wavefront.
---

It is important to get an overview of the services and applications that send data to Wavefront, understand the health of each service, and troubleshoot when your applications or services run into issues. You can get an overview and see the overall health of each application using the application map, table view, and grid view.


{% include note.html content="This page refers to the Apdex functionality in a few places. This feature is rolled out with release 2020.42." %}

<a name="app_map"></a>

## Application Map

The application map gives you an overview of how the applications and services are linked, lets you focus on a specific service, view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service, and the tracing traffic in the application. You can also drill down to the Service Dashboard and Tracing Browser.

This video highlights the application map features and settings:

<iframe src="https://bcove.video/3oDxXaa" width="700" height="400" allowfullscreen="true" alt="Wavefront intro how-to"></iframe>

See the application map:
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront cluster and log in.
1. From the taskbar, click **Applications** > **Application Status** and select the Application Map icon ( <img src="images/tracing_appmap_appmap_view_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:28px" alt="icon to click to get the application map view"/> )
1. Optionally, use <img src="images/tracing_link_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:20px" alt="icon to click to get the link"/> to get a link and share what youâ€™re seeing right now (NON-LIVE display) with other users.

Let's walk through the following scenario to get a quick overview of the application map.

<table style="width: 100%;">

## Table View

View the list of applications and services. You can see the Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics at a glance and sort the data.

See the table view:
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront cluster and log in.
1. From the taskbar, click **Applications** > **Application Status** and select the Table View icon ( <img src="images/tracing_appmap_table_view_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:28px" alt="icon to click to get the table view"/> )

![the image shows the table view of all the applications that send data to Wavefront. It has helpers to show you what to do with each UI section. For example, how to filter applications or services, change the table settings or the legend settings, and how to change back to the application map view or the grid view](images/tracing_table_view.png)

Using the table view, you can:
* Examine the applications and services, or search for a particular application or service by applying filters. 
  <br/>You can refine your search further by applying one or more filters, such as the cluster, shard, or span.kind.
* Click the name of the service to [drill down to the Service Dashboard](#explore-the-default-service-dashboard).
* Sort data:
  - Sort the application and service names alphabetically.
  - Sort the table in the ascending or descending order of the RED metrics.
* See the change (Î” value) in the RED metrics based on the time you selected for **Compare**.
<br/>For example, if you select **week ago** from the **Compare** drop-down, the Î” value indicate the change in RED metrics since the data was recorded a week ago.
  <br/>![shows the compare option on the table view. The drop down has the values, off (if selected doesn't show the change in value), 2 hours ago, day ago, week ago, and month ago. ](images/tracing_compare_table_view.png)
* Inspect the Apdex score and RED metrics to obtain a status summary of a service.

## Service Dashboard

Use the Service Dashboard identify potential hot spots, and then drill down to the Traces Browser.

See the Service Dashboard:

* Option 1:
  1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront cluster and log in.
  1. From the taskbar, click **Applications** > **Service Dashboard**.

* Option 2:
  Drill down to the Service Dashboard from the application map, table view, or grid view.

### Explore the Default Service Dashboard

The default, read-only dashboard for a service lets you explore that service, however, you can't make changes to the dashboard.

![examine services](images/tracing_services.png)

{% include note.html content="You can add these charts to a dashboard and customize them using [Tracing Templates](ui_dashboards.html#create-a-dashboard-from-a-tracing-template). " %}

On the dashboard for a particular service, you can:
* Select the time and time zone in the taskbar to customize the chart time properties.
* Use the **Jump To** pulldown to select a dashboard section:
  - Select **Overview** to examine the RED metrics that are derived from all of the spans for the service. These metrics reflect the health of the service.
  - Select an individual component to examine metrics for just that component of the service. A component could be an instrumented framework (e.g., **Jersey**) or the runtime system (e.g., **JVM**).
  - Select **System** if your environment uses Telegraf and you want to view CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.
* Filter the metrics based on the cluster, shard, or source.
* Select **Detailed View** or **Summarized View** to change the level of detail for charts.
<a name="Tracesbrowser"></a>
* Examine the TopK charts to find out which operations are potential hot spots. The bars represent operations that execute in this component of the service.
* Use <img src="images/tracing_link_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px" alt="icon to click to get the link"/> to get a link and share what youâ€™re seeing right now (NON-LIVE display) with other users.
* Navigate to the Traces Browser.
  * Click a bar on a histogram.
  * Select a region of the histogram chart and click **Search Traces** to view the traces for the selected duration.
  * Click a bar on a TopK chart.
  * Click the vertical ellipsis in the top right of any chart, click **Traces**, and click a service.
    {% include note.html content="If you donâ€™t see **Traces**, check whether your metrics include `application` and `service point` tags.<br/><br/> These tags are defined when you instrument your application for tracing via [Application tags](trace_data_details.html#application-tags). If your application is already sending this data into Wavefront via the Wavefront proxy, you can add point tags using [Wavefront proxy preprocessor rules](proxies_preprocessor_rules.html#addtag-and-addtagifnotexists)." %}

### Custom Service Dashboard

The standard dashboard for services is read-only. To create a customizable copy:

1. Click **Clone** from the ellipsis menu.
2. In the cloned dashboard, add your own charts or customize the RED metrics charts.

After you save the clone, you can find it by name from the **Dashboards** menu of the taskbar, and you can use it to drill down to the Traces Browser.

### Save Charts in the Service Dashboard

View queries used in the charts of the default Service Dashboard and save these charts to your dashboard.

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td width="45%">

### Troubleshooting

**Don't see RED metrics or see incorrect RED metrics on your charts?**

Starting with [release 2020-26.x](2020.26.x_release_notes.html), the **span.kind** filter is introduced to the default Service Dashboard. As a result, if the spans from your OpenTracing application don't have the `span.kind` point tag, the RED metrics you see on the default Service Dashboard will be incorrect, or you will not see RED metrics on your charts.

The OpenTracing SDK and Wavefront proxy versions listed below add the `span.kind` tag to the spans. Use the recommended versions to see accurate data on the default Service Dashboard.

{% include note.html content="If you are using [Wavefront Sender SDKs](tracing_instrumenting_frameworks.html#instrument-your-application-with-wavefront-sender-sdks) and sending data via the Wavefront Proxy, make sure to update to the latest proxy version."%}

## Traces Browser

In the Traces Browser, you can explore the context and the details of your application's traces.

See the Traces Browser:

* Option 1:
  1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront cluster and log in.
  1. From the taskbar, click **Applications** > **Traces**.

* Option 2:
  Drill down to the Traces Browser from the Service Dashboard, application map, table view, or grid view.

![explore trace browser](images/tracing_traces_browser.png)

From the Traces Browser, you can:
* Query for traces and view the query results in the [traces list](#query-for-a-list-of-traces).
* Select a trace in the list and:
  - Use the [service map panel](#investigate-the-service-map-for-a-trace) to investigate the services that contribute spans to the trace.
  - Use the [trace details panel](#examine-trace-details) to examine the individual spans in the trace.
* Examine a trace's percentile indicator to see how the trace's duration compares to the durations of the other listed traces.
  You can toggle the panel size for the traces list, service map, or trace details.
* Export traces by clicking <img src="images/tracing_import_traces.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px" alt="import tracing icon"/>, save the JSON file, and view them later using [Offline Traces](#view-traces-offline).
* Easily analyze your traces hierarchy and RED metrics by clicking the expand or restore icon.
  * Click the expand icon to expand the RED metrics and view them next to the trace list, and click the same icon again to restore to the default view.
    ![partial expand red metrics](images/tracing_ui_partial_expand_red_metrics.png)
  * Click the expand icon to expand the trace hierarchy and view them next to the trace list, and click the same icon again to restore to the default view.
    ![partial expand trace hierachy](images/tracing_ui_partial_expand_trace_hierarchy.png)
* Use <img src="images/tracing_link_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:25px" alt="icon to click to get the link"/> to get a link and share what youâ€™re seeing right now (NON-LIVE display) with other users.

### Query for a List of Traces

In the Traces Browser, you can [use the query builder or query editor](trace_data_query.html) to query for traces that include spans for a particular operation.

You can view the results in a traces list.

![explore traces list](images/tracing_traces_browser_traces_list.png)

Here's how to get started:
1. Add an Operation or Trace ID. See [Get Started with Trace Queries](trace_data_query.html#get-started-with-trace-queries) for details.
2. Click **Add Filter** and specify a filter to limit the results.
3. (Optional) Advanced users can use Query Editor to limit the scope even further.

You can use the trace list to:

* Sort the returned traces according to different criteria.
* Click a trace to view its context in the [service map panel](#investigate-the-service-map-for-a-trace) and its details in the [trace details panel](#examine-trace-details).
* View a trace's percentile indicator to see how the trace's duration compares to the durations of the other listed traces -- and potentially find outliers.

### Investigate the Service Map for a Trace

In the Traces Browser, use the service map to investigate the services that contribute spans to a selected trace.

![explore service map](images/tracing_traces_browser_service_map.png)

In the service map panel, you can:
* View the service dependencies, and follow the flow of request calls from service to service.
* Click on a service to display the RED metrics that reflect the health of the service:
  - Request count, error count, and trace duration at the 95th percentile, over all traces (root spans) that originate in the service.
  - Line charts that indicate the general contour of the RED metrics.
  - [Fine-tune the time window](ui_examine_data.html#fine-tune-the-time-window) of the RED metrics charts, and see [events](events.html).
* Navigate to the selected service's dashboard for more service details.
* Scroll the service map to zoom in or out, and re-center the service map.
* Look for nodes that are grayed out. These represent services that contribute spans to at least one trace in the list, but not to the trace that is currently selected.

Watch this video to see how a service map can help you pinpoint a performance bottleneck in a microservices architecture:

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7F1TTmSKN7g"><img src="/images/v_tracing_service_map.png" style="width: 700px;" alt="introduction to service maps"/></a>
</p>


### Examine Trace Details

In the Traces Browser, use the trace details panel to examine the spans that belong to a selected trace. Some of these spans may represent operations executed by other services.

![trace details](images/tracing_traces_browser_trace_details.png)

In the trace details panel, you can:
* Examine the call hierarchy for a selected trace.
* Click any span to expand and see more detail.
* Explore the traceâ€™s [critical path](#a-closer-look-at-critical-paths). This is an end-to-end sequence of blocking spans, where each blocking span must complete before the trace can complete.


### Drill Down Into Spans and View Metrics and Span Logs

In the trace details panel, you can view details about a particular span in the trace. If that span came from another service, you can navigate to the dashboard for that service.

{% include note.html content="Wavefront can only retrieve up to 1000 spans for a given trace, and you only see up to 1000 spans when you drill down into spans. Therefore, as a best practice and for optimal performance, configure your application to have less than 1000 spans in a trace."%}

![trace span details](images/tracing_span_details_with_logs.png)

Span details include:

* Application tags. These are the application, service, cluster, and shard, as selected by the trace query.
* Other tags, including the trace ID.
* A clickable link to the corresponding dashboard that lets you examine the metrics associated with the call.

If your spans have been instrumented to show span logs, you can click **Logs** to fetch the logs and drill down to examine them. We don't show span logs by default for better browser performance.

### A Closer Look at Critical Paths

The [trace details panel](#examine-trace-details) uses an orange line to show the critical path through a trace. You can think of the critical path as the end-to-end combination of spans that are the most blocking. These spans represent the sequence of operations that must complete before the trace itself can complete.

Analyzing the critical path of a trace can help you determine which operations took the most time, and can help you decide which operations to try to optimize.

We use the following rules to determine which spans to include in a critical path (in order of applicability):
1. Ignore asynchronous spans (spans tagged with `followFrom`).
2. Ignore spans that end before their parent starts.
3. If a child span continues after its parent, ignore that continuation period.
4. Choose longer spans over shorter siblings.
5. Choose later spans over earlier spans.
6. Choose child spans instead of their parent spans.

## View Traces Offline

You can export traces from Wavefront, save them locally as JSON files, and view them later using the **Offline Traces**.

1. Export Traces:
    - Export the traces via the [Traces Browser](#traces-browser) and save the JSON file.
    - Export traces via the API.
      - Use the Wavefront Swagger UI. See [API Documentation (Wavefront Instance)](wavefront_api.html#api-documentation-wavefront-instance) for details on navigating to the Wavefront Swagger UI.
        <br/>Example:
        ![UI image showing where the API is on the Wavefront Swagger UI.](images/tracing_import_tracing_swagger_UI.png)
      - Use a `curl` command that has the `/api/v2/chart/api` URL.
        <br/>Example:
        ```
        curl -X GET --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer <Wavefront_Token>" "https://<Tenant_Name>.wavefront.com/api/v2/chart/api?q=limit(100%2C%20traces(spans(%22beachshirts.shopping.*%22)))&s=1601894248&g=d&view=METRIC&sorted=false&cached=true&useRawQK=false"
        ```
1. Upload the JSON file or feed the JSON response from the API to offline traces, and view trace data. You can only upload one JSON file at a time.
    1. Click **Applications** > **Offline Traces**.
    1. Click **Upload JSON**, select the JSON file you saved that has the imported trace data, and click **Open**.
  <br/>Now, you see the trace data you imported.
  ![Shows how the offline traces look once you upload the JSOn file that has the imported trace details.](images/tracing_offline_tracing_view.png)
