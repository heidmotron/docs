With the 2021-19.x release, Wavefront addressed accessibility issues and now includes level-A accessibility fixes for keyboard navigation and colorblind support. There were a few level-AA issues addressed as well. Wavefront now allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate through pages and menus instead of using the mouse. Some of the UI elements are also with changed color so that the color contrast supports colorblind accessibility. 

With the 2021-26.x release, Wavefront includes more color contrast improvements, supports keyboard navigation in more UI pages, and also supports drag-and-drop functionality when you create or edit charts.
