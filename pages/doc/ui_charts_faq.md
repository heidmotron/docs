[Create and Customize Charts](ui_charts.html) describes most of the things you need to know to get started. This page has some special tips and tricks to help you create the user experience you're after.

## Why Do I See an Invalid Chart Type Error?

Many of the more recent chart types are supported only in the v2 UI. [Upgrade to v2](ui_v2_faq.html#how-do-i-switch-from-v1-to-v2) to get the new chart types, performance benefits, and more.   

## How Do I Set Up Color Mapping?

Color mapping is a powerful way to get users' attention when there's a problem. We support color mapping for the following charts:
* Single stat
* Gauge
* Topk
* Node map

The following example shows how to use color mapping with a single stat chart.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Data</strong> tab, specify the metrics to monitor and give a subtitle. </li>
<li>On the Sparkline tab:</li>
<ol><li>Select whether to apply the color to the Text or the Background and change <strong>Show Sparkline</strong> to <strong>No Line</strong> if you want a solid color chart. </li>
<li>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon next to <strong>Color to Value Mapping</strong> and change the values and colors to fit your use case. In the example on the right, we show red for values under 65, yellow for values under 80, and green for values over 80. </li>
<li>Save your chart. </li></ol>
</ol></td>

## How Do I Set Up Thresholds for Histograms and Heat Map Charts?

[Wavefront histograms](ui_chart_reference.html#histogram-chart) let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. [Heat map charts](ui_chart_reference.html#heat-map-chart) add another dimension to the information about histograms that you see in a histogram chart.

You can apply threshold markers for the data represented by histogram and heat map charts. The markers that you provide can be either a constant value or a variable that is defined by a query expression. The following examples show how to set up thresholds for a histogram chart.

1. On the **Data** tab, specify the metrics to monitor. For example:

    ```
    merge(hs(tracing.aggregated.derived.*.duration.micros.m, ${aggregated_filters}))
    ```

2. On the **Format** tab select the color gradient, specify the percentile markers, and click **Add Threshold**. You can do one of the following, or both:

  * Enter a constant value as a threshold, for example `100us`.

![A histogram example with a threshold defined by a constant value](images/histogram_value_threshold.png)

  * Enter a query expression as a threshold. The query must be in [Wavefront Query Language](query_language_reference.html). For example, you can enter the following queries as thresholds:

    ```
    apdexLatency(application=${application}, service=${service}, satisfied)
    ```

    ```
    apdexLatency(application=${application}, service=${service}, tolerating)
    ```

    {% include note.html content ="You must make sure that the query that you enter returns a single stat series and that the query output can be captured as a threshold value."%}

## How Do Drilldown Links Work?


A drilldown link sends users to a target dashboard when they click on a chart.

* Drilldown on click is available for the following chart types:
  - Single stat
  - Topk
  - Node map
* For all other chart types, drilldown is available from the ellipsis menu in the top right.
![drilldown example by selecting an option from the ellipsis menu](images/drilldown_ellipsis.png)

### Simple Drilldown

In most cases, you want to send users from a chart to another dashboard.
1. Open the chart for edit and click the **Drilldown Link** tab.
2. Start typing the name of the target dashboard, select from the options, and save the chart.
   ![simple drilldown to send users from a chart to another dashboard](images/simple_drilldown.png)

### Drilldown Using Local Settings


You can optionally pass along a constant, point tag value, or other value to be used in the target dashboard. Here's an example:

Suppose your users monitor 2 dashboards:
* Dashboard 1 consists of a set of single stat charts that monitor important values and change color as critical thresholds are crossed for an availability zone. Each chart is for one availability zone only. Each chart sets the `az` point tag to show only the value for that zone, for example:

  ![query for drilldown](images/drilldown_0.png)

* Dashboard 2 allows users to get details about the different availability zones. A variable (Availability Zone) is defined for that dashboard, and users can select a value for that variable.

{% include note.html content ="For this use case, a variable value that matches the point tag value must exist in dashboard 2. However, the point tag name and the variable name do not have to match."%}

You can set this up as follows:
1. Inside dashboard 1, define a drilldown link for each single stat chart that:
  - Goes to dashboard 2 when the user clicks one of the single-stat charts.
  - Passes the value of the `az` point tag in as the value of the `az` variable.
  ![drilldown definition](images/drilldown_1.png)
2. When a user sees a critical value on a chart and clicks on that chart in dashboard 1, the user is redirected to dashboard 2, and the variable is preset to show the environment that has the problem.

## Why Doesn't the Outer Ring of My Gauge Change?

If you specify color mappings for a gauge chart, the inner ring of the chart will show the current value, and the color of that inner ring depends on the color mapping thresholds.

An additional outer ring shows how the colors map to the values 1-100 by default, even if the color mapping numbers are larger than 100. To specify where you want for the outer ring to start, specify a `Min` and `Max` value.

## What Do the Summarization Options Do?

The summarization method groups raw, reported data points, and maps them to displayable values. When displaying metrics:

1. Wavefront determines the chart resolution and establishes an appropriate time interval as the chart's bucket size.
2. Wavefront then aggregates (combines) the raw data values that are reported within each such time interval (bucket) and produces a single value to display for each bucket.

The chosen summarization method determines how the aggregation is performed. Suppose the horizontal scale for your chart is `240 point buckets across, 1 bucket â€“ 30 sec (est)`. Choosing **Median** causes
us to aggregate the raw data values reported in each 30 second interval, and display the median value as the bucket point.

- **Average** - Display the average (mean) of the raw data values in each bucket.
- **Median** - Display the median of the raw data values in each bucket.
- **Min** - Display the minimum raw data value in each bucket.
- **Max** - Display the maximum raw data value in each bucket.
- **Count** - Display the number of raw data values in each bucket.
- **Sum** - Display the sum of the raw data values in each bucket.
- **First** - Display the first raw data value to be reported in each bucket.
- **Last** - Display the last raw data value to be reported in each bucket.
