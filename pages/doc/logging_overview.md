    In a microservice architecture, the services in an application are distributed, and you need to monitor each service carefully to ensure that your overall application runs smoothly. Tanzu Observability helps you monitor your application using metrics, traces, and logs.
    For example: 
    <ul>
      <li> 
        You can use metrics to get the numerical data to identify the performance issues in a system 
      </li>
      <li> 
        use traces to get an overview of your entire application and discover the services or service requests that donâ€™t perform as expected
      </li>
      <li> 
        and use logs to debug the issues.
      </li>
    </ul>
