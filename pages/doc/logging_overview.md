    In a microservice architecture, the services in an application are distributed, and you need to monitor each service carefully to ensure that your overall application runs smoothly. Tanzu Observability helps you monitor your application using metrics, traces, and logs.
    For example, you can: 
    <ul>
      <li> 
        Use metrics to get the numerical data and identify the performance issues in a system. 
      </li>
      <li> 
        Use traces to get an overview of your entire application and discover the services or service requests that don’t perform as expected.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Use logs to debug the issues.
      </li>
    </ul>

{%include note.html content="Tanzu Observability retains the logs you send for 14 days. If you want to keep the data for a longer time, contact [technical support](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_support_feedback.html#support) for help."%}

## What's a Log?

Logs are structured or unstructured text records of events that took place at a given time. You needs to send logs as a JSON payload. 
Logs in Tanzu Observability include the following attributes:

<table style="width: 100;">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">
      Attribute
    </th>
    <th width="80%">
      Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
       Tags
    </td>
    <td>
      Tags are key value pairs that help you add meta data to your logs. You can filter logs using tags.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Source
    </td>
    <td markdown="span">
      A source is a unique application, host, container, or instance that emits metrics. You can filter logs using source.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Timestamp
    </td>
    <td>
      The timestamp the log was created in the Epoch time format.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Message
    </td>
    <td>
      The message includes the details of an event.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Logging Architecture

You can send your logs to Tanzu observability using a Log Shipper. The FluentD log shipper is supported out of the box. If you are using a different log shipper, reach out to [technical support](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_support_feedback.html#support) for help.

See [Send logs to Tanzu Observability](logging_send_logs.html) for detailed steps.

![the images shows how logs are sent from a log shipper to the tanzu observability components](images/loggging_send_logs.png)


## View Logs and Troubleshoot

Once your send your logs to Tanzu Observability, you can view all your logs and drill down from charts, alerts, application map, and the traces browser to see logs and find the root cause of an issue.

![this diagram shows all the UIs that link to logs. they are explained in this section.](images/logging_all_ui.png)

### Search for Logs on the Log  Browser

See all the logs you sent to Tanzu Observability using the log browser. You can:

* See logs for a selected time range.
* Filter logs using tags and source, or search for logs that have specific keywords.
* See how many logs are there for a specified time using the histogram chart and identify hotspots.
* Group logs using tags.
* Share the Logs Browser data you see with other users.

![a screenshot of the log browser](images/logging_log_browser.png)

### Drill in to Logs from Charts

Did you notice data anomalies on your chart and want to debug the issue using the logs you sent? Right-click on the chart and click **Logs**. You navigate to the Log Browser, and you see the logs for the time and source defined on the chart.

If you don’t see logs, see [FAQ](logging_faq.html#dont-see-logs-when-drilling-down-from-a-chart).

![A screenshot of a chart when you right click it . Click logs to go to the log browser](images/logging_charts_to_logs.png)

### Drill in to Logs from an Alert

When an alert fires, you get a notification with the alert details and the logs related to the alert.

![A screenshot of an alert with the logs tags](images/logging_alerts_to_logs.png)

**Time range tag**:

A time range tag is generated by default from the time the condition to fire the alert is met to the time the alert is fired. 
For example, the screenshot shows:
* The alert started to fire at 6.10 AM. 
* It fired because the condition for the alert to fire was met for 2 mins starting at 6.08 AM. 
* Therefore, when you click **Go To Logs** from the alert, you see the log data from 6.08 AM to 6.10 AM. These logs help you identify the root cause that made the alert fire.

**Additional tags**:

When you create or update an alert, you can configure the alert to filter logs using additional tags. For example, the screenshot shows that the alert was configured to show logs for the given time range and filter the logs further using the wavefront application.
