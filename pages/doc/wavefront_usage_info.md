How much your company pays for using Tanzu Observability by Wavefront depends on PPS (point per second). What you pay is based on data throughput, primarily:
* **Data ingestion**. When the Wavefront service ingests data, those data count toward your PPS allocation.
* **Data analysis**. When you run a query, either as part of an alert or when you look at a dashboard, the backend has to process the data, and those data points count toward your PPS allocation.

This page helps you get value from your PPS and avoid overage (overage is an extra fee that customers with certain contracts have to pay if they consume more data than they paid for).

## Where Do I Start?

Each customer has a contract with VMware that allows them to send a predetermined amount of data, measured in points per second (PPS) to their Wavefront instance.

If the customer uses more than the contracted rate, VMware bills for those additional data. Because VMware has to pay the cloud provider for data consumed by each Wavefront instances, we have to ensure that customers pay for the data they consume. But we want for you to get the largest amount of useful information possible from your data. This page has some tips.

### How Do Find Usage Information?

Your Wavefront instance includes dashboards and charts that help you determine how close you are to your contracted rate and to explore remediation options.

## How Can I Optimize My Ingestion Rate?

Billing for Tanzu Observability is based primarily on the ingestion rate, so it's a good practice to look for ways to optimize and reduce your ingestion rate.

### Examine Ingestion with the Namespace Usage Explorer

The **Wavefront Namespace Usage Explorer** dashboard can help you pinpoint where data are coming from.
1. Log in to your Wavefront instance.
2. In the toolbar, select **Integrations**, and click the **Wavefront Usage** integration.
3. Select the **Dashboards** tab and then the **Wavefront Namespace Usage Explorer** dashboard.

This dashboard provides not only a current view but also a historical view. Start at the level 1 namespace to identify the top level. Then dive into levels 2 and 3 for finer-grained information to answer these questions:
* How many different namespaces do I have at each level?
* What are my top namespaces?
* Which are the top 10 metric namespaces and trends over time at each level?

The screenshot below shows an example from our demo server. The data are prefixed with the data source. In the pie chart, we can see that the top namespaces include `pcf` and `kubernetes`.

![Metrics namespace dashboard screenshot](images/metrics_namespace_dashboard.png)

The Namespace Usage Explorer is especially useful if your metrics use hierarchical name spaces of up to 3 levels that identify who sends which metrics. For example, some of our customers use namespaces that show the Business Unit (Level 1), team (Level 2), and data source. For example, you might have `monitoring.dev.kubernetes` and `monitoring.sales.kubernetes` for Kubernetes data coming from the dev and sales time in the monitoring Business Unit.


### (Optional) Clone Namespace Explorer and Create Custom Charts

If you don't see the information you need, for example if need to look at histogram ingestion, clone the **Namespace Usage Explorer** dashboard and modify existing charts or create custom charts. You can use `cs()`, `hs()` and `spans()` queries to retrieve information about counters, histograms, and spans. For example, the default dashboard examines `~metric` information, but you can also examine other data using the following format:

```
cs(~<data_type>.global.namespace.<namespace>.pps, source=<depth_number>)
```

Here's an example query that returns the top 10 Level 1 metrics:

```
rawsum(align(1m, taggify(cs("~metric.global.namespace.*.ppm", source="depth_1"), metric, Name, 3)), Name) / 60
```

{% include tip.html content="The default delimiter for namespaces is a period. [Contact Support](wavefront_support_feedback.html#support) to request a custom delimiter." %}

### Drill Down with Wavefront Top and Wavefront Spy API

If you need more than 3 levels of namespaces or if the dashboard doesn't answer your questions for other reasons, Wavefront Top and the Spy API show in detail whatâ€™s happening right now.
* [Wavefront Top](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wftop) supports metrics and IDs.
* The [Wavefront Spy API](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html) also supports delta counters, histograms, spans, and span logs.

With Wavefront Top you can:
* Dive into deeper levels of the namespace than with the Namespace Explorer dashboard.
* View ingestion rate by source, point tag, or ingestion source.
* See what percentage of currently ingested data within a namespace is actually accessed in queries over X days. The number of days defaults to 7 and is configurable.
* See what range of values is sent in for a particular namespace.
* See the data lag for a particular namespace.

{% include tip.html content="You cannot see the information over time from Wavefront Top. Use one of the Wavefront Usage dashboards instead if possible." %}

The [Wavefront Spy API](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html) gives even more detail, but in most cases Wavefront Top is sufficient.

### Consider Sending Data Less Frequently

Even though Tanzu Observability supports second-level granularity for metric data points,  data rarely needs to be that granular.

* If some data does not need to be that granular, there can be significant savings just by increasing the interval at which that data reports. For example, switching from a 1-second interval to a 1-minute interval results in a 60x reduction in the ingestion rate for that set of data.

* Another area to explore for adjusting reporting intervals is *constant values*. Values that do not change often are great candidates for increasing reporting intervals.

    You can use [Wavefront Top](wavefront_monitoring_spy.html#get-started-with-wavefront-top-and-spy) to uncover constant values. The *Range* column shows the range of the reported values (the maximum value minus the minimum value) for each namespace.

    - If the range is *0*, then this data set is most likely reporting constant values.

    - If the range does not change, it is also possible that only a few fixed values are reported and the data set can also be a candidate for increased reporting intervals.


## How Can I Optimize My Scan Rate?

Each time a query is executed, the points that the query engine looks at are counted toward your PPS.
* If you examine a dashboard, all queries on the dashboard are executed. What precisely that means for your PPS depends in part on the time window the dashboard uses.
* When an alert is checked, the alert queries are executed.

If you ensure that your environment doesn't include unused dashboards or alerts, you can significantly improve your scan rate.
