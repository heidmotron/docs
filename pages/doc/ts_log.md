## Description

The `log()` function produces a time series in which each data value is equal to the natural logarithm (log base _e_) of the value or values specified by the expression. The natural logarithm is the power to which you need to raise _e_ to obtain the specified value. In mathematics, <code>log<sub><em>e</em></sub></code> can be written `ln`.
* If `tsExpression` describes a constant value _`N`_, then `log()` returns a continuous series where every data value is <code>log<sub><em>e</em></sub> <em>N</em></code>.
* If `tsExpression` describes one or more time series, then `log()` returns a new time series for each input time series.
Each value in a new time series is calculated as <code>log<sub><em>e</em></sub> <em>V</em></code>, where _`V`_ is the value of the corresponding point in the input time series.


The inverse of this function is [`exp()`](ts_exp.html).

By default, the chart legend displays a rounded version of the result. You can cause the legend to display the result with more precision by holding down the shift key when you hover over the time series.

## Examples

In this example, we see the result (in red) of using `log(4)` to find the power of _e_ that equals 4. We also see the result (in blue) of obtaining the inverse by applying the `exp()` function to the result of `log(4)`.

Here we see the result (in orange) of using `log()` to take the natural log of a time series (in purple).
