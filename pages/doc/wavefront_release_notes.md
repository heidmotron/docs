* **New Functions**: With this release, we add the `retainDimension` and `removeDimension` functions that allow you to perform matching operations, similar to the PromQL [PromQL Operators/Vector Matching Operators]https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#vector-matching).

For Wavefront Proxy, your go-to place is the [Wavefront proxy github page](https://GitHub.com/wavefrontHQ/java/releases). On that page, you can see releases in progress and GA versions. If proxy changes are important for the service, we update this doc set, for example, with new configuration parameters, ports, etc.
