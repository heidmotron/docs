Tanzu Observability by Wavefront continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.

## March 2022

We added the following integrations in March 2022:
