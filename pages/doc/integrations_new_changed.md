summary: New and changed Wavefront integrations.

Wavefront continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.

## January 2022

We added the following integration in January 2022:

* Velero

  You can now monitor the Velero backup and restore solution. This integration is developed and created by the community and falls into to the **Community Integrations** section of the Wavefront **Integrations** page. We do not validate the community integrations and they are not fully supported by the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront team.

## All 2018 - 2021 Integrations Release Notes

We have separate pages for:

* [New and Changed Integrations in 2021](integrations_new_changed_2021.html)
* [New and Changed Integrations in 2019-2020](integrations_new_changed_2020.html)
