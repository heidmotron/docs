summary: Share links to dashboards and charts, give dashboard access, and create embedded charts.

You can
* Share a link to a dashboard or chart so someone else can see what's going on.
* Share [access](access.html) to a dashboard if the user is not in a group that has access to that specific dashboard.
<!---* Embed an interactive chart outside Wavefront.--->

{% include shared/badge.html content="Every Wavefront user can view dashboards and make temporary changes. You must have [Dashboard permission](permissions_overview.html) to share a link to a dashboard or chart." %}

## Share a Link with the Share Icon

The easiest way to share a link is the share icon in the bottom right quadrant of the page. Use this link to share a link to what you're seeing right now (NON-LIVE display).

## Share a Link with the Share Dialog

Wavefront allows you to share dashboards and charts with other authorized users of your environment. We support two options:
* Non-live view -- Links to a snapshot of what you're looking at right now.
* Live view -- Changes as the dashboard or alert changes.

{% include note.html content="If access control is on, and you share a link with a user who does not have view access, the user cannot view the dashboard. You have to share access before you share the link."%}

**To share a dashboard using a link**
1. Navigate to the dashboard and click the Share Dashboard icon.

   ![share dashboard icon](images/share_dashboard_icon.png)
2. Select the **Shared Links** tab and click the button to copy the link you want to share:

   | Share link to the NON-LIVE display | The link recipient will see, at any time, what you see. For example, if you share a non-live link, and the recipient opens the links 3 hours later, that link shows the state of the system 3 hours ago. Even if you make changes, the link recipient only sees the snapshot of the dashboard at the time you copied the link.|
   |  Share link to the LIVE display | The link recipient sees the live display of the current dashboard. If the dashboard changed after you sent the link, the recipient sees those changes. |

## Share Access to Dashboards or Alerts

If the [access control](access.html) for an individual dashboard or alert has been set so that access is blocked by default, the following users can share access with other users and groups:
* The dashboard creator
* Super Admin
* Any user who has View & Modify access because someone already shared access to the dashboard with that user.

The process is very similar for dashboards and for alerts.

**To grant or revoke dashboard access**:

1. Navigate to the dashboard and click the Share Dashboard icon.

   ![share dashboard icon](images/share_dashboard_icon.png)
2. Click **Accounts & Groups**.
3. To grant access:
   1. Start typing an account or a group name in the **View Dashboard** or **View & Modify Dashboard** text box.
   2. Select the group or user to give access.
4. To revoke access, delete the group or user. 
5. Click **Update**.

## Embed a Chart in Other UIs and Allow or Restrict Access

Wavefront supports the ability to embed an interactive chart outside of Wavefront. You must have [**Chart Embedding** Permission](permissions_overview.html) to create embedded charts.

### Embed a Chart in Other UIs

1. Open the chart that you want to embed in the chart editor.
    1. Navigate to the dashboard in which your chart is included, click the ellipsis icon, and select **Edit**.
    2. Click the ellipsis icon of the chart that you want to embed, and select **Edit**.
2. Click the embed icon (`<\>`).

2. Click **Create**. A dialog containing an HTML code snippet like the one below displays:

    ![embed_chart_snippet](images/embed_chart_snippet.png)

3. Copy the snippet by clicking the **Copy to clipboard** icon, and paste it into the desired location. You can adjust the `width` and `height` parameters.

### Allow or Deny Access to Embedded Charts

You can apply access policies and deny or allow access to the embedded charts by using the Wavefront REST API. The `Access Policy` controls which IP addresses can access the embedded charts and doesn't affect any other URLs or Wavefront functionality. Learn more about the [categories in the Wavefront API](wavefront_api.html#wavefront-rest-api-categories).

When you apply an access policy rule, take in mind the following:

* When you apply an `Access Policy` rule, it may take up to 10 minutes to take effect.
* If you want to remove the rules at a later point, you can set the policy to `{"policyRules": []}‚Äù`.
* Only IPv4 subnet masks are supported.
* You should put any DENY rules at the end.

The following snippet provides with access a single IPv4 address, namely `192.168.1.2`. The IPv4 addresses that you provide when you apply Access Policy rules, must be in CIDR format to match an IP address range. All other IP addresses will be denied. 

When a request comes in, the rules are checked in the order in which you entered them and exited as soon as a matching rule is found. You must specify all of your ALLOW rules first and the DENY rules at the end to catch any additional IP addresses. 

```
{
 "policyRules": [
 {
   "name": "allow-single-ip",
   "description": "Allow a single IP address.",
   "action": "ALLOW",
   "subnet": "192.168.1.2/32"
 },
 {
   "name": "default-deny",
   "description": "Deny All.",
   "action": "DENY",
   "subnet": "0.0.0.0/0"
 }
 ]
}
```
