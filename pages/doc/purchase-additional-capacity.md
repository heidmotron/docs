As a Wavefront Super Admin, you can request more PPS to be added to the active subscription of your organization.

1. Log in to your Wavefront instance as a Super Admin user.
2. From the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> on the taskbar, select **Usage Portal**.
3. Click the **Subscriptions** tab.

    You can see details about the current and past subscriptions of your organization.
4. In the last column for your active subscription, click **Add more capacity**.
5. In the **Additional capacity** field, enter the number of kilo-points per second to add to the current commitment.
6. Verify the calculated **New commitment** of PPS per month and **Current Level** pricing tier, and click **Next**.
7. Choose the current billing model and commit duration for the subscription, and click **Proceed to checkout**.

    You cannot change the original billing model and commit duration for the subscription.
8. On the VMware Cloud Services page, you can review and place your order.

After you purchase additional capacity, you will see a confirmation page and your subscription will become updated within the next 24 hours.

In case of urgency, you can contact the Wavefront team by sending an email to: `tanzu_saas_ops@vmware.com` with the number of your order and someone from our team will help you.
