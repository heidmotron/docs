As a Wavefront Super Admin, you can request more PPS to be added to the active Wavefront subscription of your organization.

1. Log in to your Wavefront instance as a Super Admin user.
2. From the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> on the taskbar, select **Usage Portal**.
3. Click the **Subscriptions** tab.

    You can see a detailed list of the current and past subscriptions of your organization.
4. In the last column for your active Wavefront subscription, click **Add more capacity**.
5. In the **Additional capacity** field, enter the number of kilo-points per second to add to the current commitment.
6. Verify the calculated **New commitment** of PPS per month and **Current Level** pricing tier, and click **Next**.
7. Choose the billing model and commit duration for the additional capacity, and click **Proceed to checkout**.

    The billing model and commit duration is the same as for the original subscription.

After you purchase additional capacity, you will receive a confirmation email and your subscription will become updated within the next 24 hours.

In case of urgency, you can contact the Wavefront team by sending an email to: `tanzu_saas_ops@vmware.com` with the number of your order and someone from our team will help you.
