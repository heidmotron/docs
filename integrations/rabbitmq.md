## RabbitMQ Integration

RabbitMQ is a popular open source message broker. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send RabbitMQ metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of the dashboard:

To see a list of the metrics for this integration, select the integration from <https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs>.
## RabbitMQ Setup



### Step 1. Install the Telegraf Agent

This integration uses the RabbitMQ input plugin for Telegraf. If you've already installed Telegraf on your server(s), you can skip to Step 2.

Log in to your Wavefront instance and follow the instructions in the **Setup** tab to install Telegraf and a Wavefront proxy in your environment. If a proxy is already running in your environment, you can select that proxy and the Telegraf install command connects with that proxy.

### Step 2. Enable the RabbitMQ Management Plugin

This integration requires the [RabbitMQ Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) to be enabled on the RabbitMQ server.

To enable the management plugin:{% raw %}
```
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 3. Configure RabbitMQ Input Plugin

Create a file called `rabbitmq.conf` in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d` and enter the following snippet:
{% raw %}
```
 [[inputs.rabbitmq]]
  url = "http://your.rabbitmq.server:15672"
  username = "guest"
  password = "guest"
```
{% endraw %}

Modify the `url`, `username` and `password` properties appropriately.

**Note:** The RabbitMQ Management API is accessed over port `15672` by default. Modify the port in the `url` if different.

To monitor specific nodes, include the `nodes` property. For example:{% raw %}
```
  nodes = ["rabbit@node1", "rabbit@node2"]
```
{% endraw %}
If not specified metrics for all nodes are gathered.

Configure additional `[[inputs.rabbitmq]]` entries to monitor multiple RabbitMQ instances.  

### Step 4. Restart Telegraf

Run `sudo service telegraf restart` to restart your agent.
