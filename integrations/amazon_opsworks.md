### Alerts

The Amazon Web Services integration dashboards contains pre-defined alert conditions embedded as queries in charts contained in the dashboards. For example:

{% include image.md src="images/alert_condition.png" width="30" %}

To create the alert, click the **Create Alert** link under the query and configure the [alert properties](https://docs.wavefront.com/alerts.html#creating-an-alert) (notification targets, condition checking frequency, etc.).

### Metrics Configuration

Wavefront ingests Amazon Web Services metrics using the CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS service APIs. For details on the metrics and how to configure ingestion, see [AWS Metrics Integration](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_metrics.html).

### Adding an Amazon Cloud Integration

Setting up an Amazon cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Wavefront.

You start by granting Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account or by giving Wavefront the permissions listed in [Giving Wavefront Limited Access](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_overview.html#giving-wavefront-limited-access).
