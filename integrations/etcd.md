## etcd KV Store Integration

The etcd KV Store integration installs and configures Telegraf to send etcd KV Store performance metrics to Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process that can collect, process, aggregate and send metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the Cluster Health section of a dashboard displaying etcd metrics.

To see a list of the metrics for this integration, select the integration from <https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs>.
## etcd Distributed Database Setup



This integration uses the Prometheus Telegraf input plugin.


### Step 1. Install the Telegraf Agent

Follow the steps below to install the Telegraf agent and optional Wavefront proxy. Telegraf agent can be installed on a node where etcd is running or on a node that has access to the metrics endpoint of etcd. If you've already installed the agent and proxy, you can skip to Step 2.

Log in to your Wavefront instance and follow the instructions in the **Setup** tab to install Telegraf and a Wavefront proxy in your environment. If a proxy is already running in your environment, you can select that proxy and the Telegraf install command connects with that proxy.

### Step 2. Configure Prometheus Input Plugin

Create a file called `etcd.conf` in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d` and enter the following snippet:
{% raw %}
```
[[inputs.prometheus]]
  urls = ["http://<Host-IP>:2379/metrics"]
```
{% endraw %}
Configure global tags in the `telegraf.conf` file to group etcd nodes into clusters, as in the following snippet:
{% raw %}
```
[global_tags]
  #Setting environment tags like prod, dev, perf, and test
  env = "prod"
```
{% endraw %}

### Step 3. Restart Telegraf

Run `sudo service telegraf restart` to restart your agent.
